# Low-Level Design (LLD) Roadmap

Low-Level Design (LLD) focuses on designing the internal structure of a system, including classes, methods, and interactions. This roadmap will guide you through the essential concepts and skills required to master LLD.

---

## 1. **Prerequisites**
- **Programming Fundamentals**
  - Master at least one programming language (e.g., Java, Python, C++).
  - Understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:
    - Classes and Objects
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Trees, Graphs, HashMaps
  - Sorting and Searching algorithms

---

## 2. **Core LLD Concepts**
- **Object-Oriented Design (OOD) Principles**
  - SOLID Principles:
    - Single Responsibility Principle
    - Open/Closed Principle
    - Liskov Substitution Principle
    - Interface Segregation Principle
    - Dependency Inversion Principle
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- **Design Patterns**
  - Creational Patterns:
    - Singleton
    - Factory
    - Builder
  - Structural Patterns:
    - Adapter
    - Composite
    - Proxy
  - Behavioral Patterns:
    - Strategy
    - Observer
    - Command

## 3. **System Design Basics**
- **Understanding Requirements**
  - Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements
  - Use Case Diagrams
- **Class Diagrams**
  - UML Basics
  - Relationships: Association, Aggregation, Composition
- **Sequence Diagrams**
  - Interaction between objects over time

---

## 4. **Hands-On Practice**
- **Design Real-World Systems**
  - Design a Parking Lot System
  - Design an Online Bookstore
  - Design a Food Delivery System
- **Code Implementation**
  - Translate designs into working code.
  - Focus on clean, modular, and testable code.

---

## 5. **Advanced Topics**
- **Concurrency and Multithreading**
  - Thread Safety
  - Deadlocks and Race Conditions
- **Scalability Considerations**
  - Caching
  - Database Design
- **Design for Maintainability**
  - Code Reviews
  - Refactoring Techniques

---

## 6. **Resources**
- **Books**
  - "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides
  - "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin
  - "Head First Design Patterns" by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson
- **Online Courses**
  - System Design Primer (GitHub)
  - Low-Level Design on Educative.io
- **Practice Platforms**
  - LeetCode
  - HackerRank
  - GeeksforGeeks

---

## 7. **Tips for Success**
- Start with small projects and gradually increase complexity.
- Collaborate with peers to review and improve designs.
- Stay updated with industry trends and best practices.
