# Microservices Architecture: Principles and Patterns

Microservices architecture has emerged as a dominant approach for building complex, scalable applications. In this post, I'll explore the fundamental principles, common patterns, and practical strategies for implementing microservices effectively.

## What Are Microservices?

Microservices architecture is an approach to building software systems that focuses on creating small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service is:

- **Focused on a specific business capability**
- **Independently deployable**
- **Loosely coupled with other services**
- **Owned by a small team**

This stands in contrast to monolithic architecture, where all functionality exists within a single codebase.

## Key Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility

Each microservice should have a single responsibility and focus on doing one thing well. This aligns with the Single Responsibility Principle from SOLID design principles.

### 2. Autonomous

Microservices should be autonomous entities that can be:
- Developed independently
- Deployed independently
- Scaled independently
- Tested independently

### 3. Domain-Driven Design

Microservices should be modeled around business domains, not technical concerns. This often means organizing teams around business capabilities rather than technology layers.

## Common Patterns

### API Gateway Pattern

The API Gateway acts as the single entry point for client applications. It handles concerns like:

```java
@RestController
public class ApiGatewayController {
    
    @Autowired
    private OrderService orderService;
    
    @Autowired
    private CustomerService customerService;
    
    @GetMapping("/customer-orders/{customerId}")
    public CustomerOrdersDTO getCustomerOrders(@PathVariable String customerId) {
        // Aggregate data from multiple services
        CustomerDTO customer = customerService.getCustomer(customerId);
        List<OrderDTO> orders = orderService.getOrdersForCustomer(customerId);
        
        return new CustomerOrdersDTO(customer, orders);
    }
}
